<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Throughout my life I have immensely enjoyed making beautiful things and doing a variety of crafts. 
  Besides digital printable, I like to make hair bows, cross stitch, wreaths, photography, and design jewelry. 
  Eventually, I ended up with a decision to open my own Etsy store to sell digital prints online. 
  However, my artistic minds didn't stop there.There was one subject that I have wanted to learn and complete was web development. 
  </p>

<p>My husband had paid an online web development course of Udemy.com for me to learn a year ago. I tried to learned back then, but I didn't succeed to complete.
  Because I was too tired at night to learn web development after I put both my daughters to bed.
  I function better during the day as I am a morninginvolving  person not night owl. My minds occasionally goes back of wanting to my uncomplete online web developing course, especially when I am at work doing my accouting tasks.
  I used Microsoft Access to create some databases for my work. The creation of my databases in Access required the core components of being web developer was designing and writing out visual basic codes.

<p>In mid January 2024, I finally put my thought into action was that I resumed to study web development online. 
  I changed my strategy of learning was to study on the weekend in the morning. The content of each section is very interesting to me and makes me wanting to come back next time to continue learning the next part.
 I am happily to say that I am progressing in the right direction to complete this time and determined to become a web developer.</p
